5.2 Generally.  The Website and the Services are intended solely for recreational, entertainment purposes.  We are committed to ensuring that players have the ability to manage or limit their play on the Website.  If gambling is negatively affecting your personal or professional life, please refer to the resources available here to seek counsel or assistance.
5.3 Self-Administered Limit Controls.  We maintain processes for you to manage and limit your deposits on the Website.  You may limit your deposits on a monthly basis.  Note that the deposit limit will apply as an aggregate limit for all deposit instruments attached to the Account at the time of the limit request only.  Note further that if you self-impose a monthly deposit limit and later wish to increase or remove such limit, such removal or increase will not take place until at least 24 hours following the limit increase request.

You have the option of setting your play limits to zero or completely closing the Account if you believe you have a gambling problem.  We honor all such directions immediately.  Note that if you elect not to close the Account, the deposit limit will apply as an aggregate limit for all deposit instruments attached to the Account at the time of the limit request only.  Please note that when contacting Customer Service to implement such measures, you must identify that you are requesting an Account closure or deposit limit due to a gambling problem.  This is to ensure that such requests are distinguishable from temporary "cooling off" requests (see Section 5.5).  If you request to have your Account closed or your Account limit set to zero as a consequence of a perceived gambling problem, please be advised that your Account will be permanently closed without the option to re-open.
5.5 Temporarily Setting Limit to Zero / "Cooling Off".  You have the option of setting your deposit limits to zero to allow you to "cool off" or to otherwise manage your play patterns.  Note that the deposit limit will apply as an aggregate limit for all deposit instruments attached to the Account at the time of the limit request only.   Self-imposed zero limits that are not identified as being imposed due to perceived problem gambling are not subject to the six-month period noted in Section 5.4.  However, please note that any subsequent increase in limits must be made in writing (which may include email) and will not be implemented until 24 hours following the receipt of such limit increase request.

Use by players of external player assistance programs ("EPA Programs") which are designed to provide players with an unfair advantage over their opponents are expressly prohibited. We define EPA Programs as including computer software and non-software-based databases or profiles (e.g., web sites and subscription services) and we consider access to or the ability to gather data or information on other players by any means that would not be accessible via their own first-hand experience (i.e. observation of game play) to be "unfair".  We reserve the right to close Accounts and void any and all winnings in such Accounts if we establish, in our reasonable discretion, the use of an EPA Program.
6.4 "Bots" Prohibited.  All actions on the Website must be executed by players via the supplied user interface.  We will take any measures necessary to ensure that all robot software or programs designed to simulate real player play will be detected and prevented from accessing the Website.

If, in our reasonable discretion, we determine that an Account is employing such software, the Account will be disabled and all Account balances (including both deposits and any winnings) shall be forfeited.

Any players who gain, or attempt to gain an advantage by trading information about their cards, or attempt to take any unfair advantage by colluding with other players will be permanently banned from the Website.  If, in our reasonable discretion, we determine that such activity is occurring, the Accounts may, in our sole and absolute discretion, be disabled and all Account balances (including both deposits and any winnings) shall be forfeited.  Rigorous examination of play by both manual and automated means will be employed to detect such behavior and such monitoring will be active at all times.  We will investigate all related player complaints in addition to proactively and randomly examining game plays and Accounts.   Collusion includes, without limitation: sharing information about their cards, chip dumping, discussing a hand during play (both in client chat or externally), multiple players using a single Account, soft playing and chip transferring.

In such event, in our discretion, such Accounts may be closed and all Account balances (including both deposits and any winnings) may be forfeited.  
6.7 "Betting Syndicates".  A player or group of players working together in any fashion (also known as a "syndicate"), to receive either eCash winnings or activity bonuses or otherwise, may only have one Account in total, and any redundant Accounts will be consolidated into the one Account.

6.8 Abuse of Bonus Programs.  Bonus programs are intended for recreational bettors only.  Professional players or players considered, in our sole discretion, to be abusing the bonus system by any means may have bonuses revoked and be subject to further sanctions.  Bonus abuse may be defined as (but not restricted to) clients cashing out for the purpose of re-depositing, depositing on top of an existing balance, or referring new accounts that they are using themselves.  Sanctions may be in the form of increased rollover requirements or loss of bonus privileges altogether for the offending Account as well as any linked Accounts. We reserve the right to restrict eligibility for special offers and bonuses when necessary. This includes (but is not limited to) placing geographic restrictions on match bonuses due to bonus abuse.
6.9 Abuse of System Vulnerability.  If, in our reasonable discretion, we determine that an Account sought to or actually did exploit any hardware or software error, malfunction, "bug" or other vulnerability, we shall immediately close such Account and all Account balances, including both deposits and any winnings, shall be immediately forfeited.  If, in our reasonable discretion, we determine that such activity is occurring, the Account(s) may, in our sole and absolute discretion, be disabled and all Account balances (including both deposits and any winnings) shall be forfeited.  In such event, we expressly reserve the right to initiate civil legal proceedings and report such activities to authorities in support of criminal investigations and charges, as appropriate. 
6.10 Integrity of Sport.  We are committed to ensuring the integrity of sport and to participating in efforts to identify and eradicate match fixing. As such, notwithstanding any other term of the this Agreement, or any provision of the applicable Privacy Policy, by placing a bet or wager on the Website, you expressly acknowledge and agree that we at all times reserve the right in our sole discretion to report Irregular Betting Activity to such sports federations, regulators, agencies, commissions or associations (or their respective agents) as we deem appropriate ("Regulatory Bodies") in order to enable identification of irregular activity and to support appropriate investigations.

We shall use reasonable commercial measures to ensure that any information provided to Regulatory Bodies pursuant to this provision is subject to reasonable contractual non-disclosure provisions, and that all information or documentation shall be destroyed by such Regulatory Bodies when it is no longer relevant in connection with any ongoing investigation, enquiry or disciplinary process.

6.13 Communications During Play.  We reserve the right to limit the ability for players of playing at the same poker table or tournament.  Poker "chat" may be conducted in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Mandarin. Players using any language in chat other than the ones mentioned may have their chat privileges disabled, either temporarily or permanently in our sole and absolute discretion.  Players and observers may not discuss a poker hand until the hand is completed. Discussing cards discarded or hand possibilities, real or not, is not allowed.
